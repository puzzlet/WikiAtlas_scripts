# Automatic Label Placement

This example is an extension of Mike Bostockâ€™s tutorial [Lets Make a Map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) that implements automatic label placement using the force layout and multiple foci. The centroid of each feature will define a foci of the force. This foci will attract the label that correspond to that feature (and ignore the others). The labels will repel themselves to avoid overlapping.
